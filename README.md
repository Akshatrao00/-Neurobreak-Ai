🧠 AI that evolves, commits, and loops endlessly.
# 🧠 NeuroBreak: The Self-Evolving Code Mutator AI

> An AI that evolves its own codebase, evaluates its changes, and pushes the best version in an infinite loop.

## 🚀 What is NeuroBreak?

NeuroBreak is a simulated Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) prototype that:

- **Trains** a mock AI model
- **Reads and rewrites** its own code
- **Scores** the modified version
- **Commits & pushes** changes if improvement is detected
- **Loops forever** until `kill_switch.txt` is triggered

> ⚠️ Caution: This project demonstrates infinite AI automation, with full recursive feedback.

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🧠 Model Trainer | Simulates an AI learning from its codebase |
| ✍️ Code Modifier | Generates new code based on 'model' logic |
| 🧪 Evaluator | Scores changes using random logic (mocked) |
| 🔁 GitHub Actions | Self-commits and pushes improved versions |

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repo
https://github.com/your-username/NeuroBreak-AI.git
cd NeuroBreak-AI

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run manually (optional)
python selfloop.py
```

> Or simply push to GitHub and let **GitHub Actions** handle it!

---

## 🧨 Kill Switch
Create an empty file named `kill_switch.txt` in the root directory to safely stop the loop.
```bash
touch kill_switch.txt
```

## 📢 Why This Project?
> Inspired by the idea of an AI that can improve itself infinitely, NeuroBreak mimics a simplified version of recursive self-improvement—one of the goals of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Feel free to fork, break, mutate, or enhance it. NeuroBreak is meant to be **unstable, infinite, and terrifyingly alive**. 😈
