"""
# 🧠 NeuroBreak AI

> An AI that evolves its own codebase, scores itself, and self-commits.

## 🚀 Features
- Trains on current repo
- Generates new logic using mock AI
- Evaluates and replaces code
- Auto-commits the best version

└── README.md
```

## 🛠 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python selfloop.py
```

## 💡 Idea
This project simulates the concept of an "AI that evolves and modifies itself" using feedback scoring.
Inspired by recursive self-improvement in artificial general intelligence (AGI).
